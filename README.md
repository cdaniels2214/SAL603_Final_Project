# SAL603_Final_Project
# I am going to analyze FBS College Football teams (finding the FCS data was excruciating given the significant popularity difference between FBS/FCS from 2022-2024 by their roster height and weight as it may or may not relate to winning %, offensive stats, defensive stats, # and MAYBE break it down by offensive/defensive positions. 
# Examples: 
  # if having a bigger OL means more rushing yards, or a bigger DL/LBs means less for the opposition
  # if smaller/larger skill positions (WR/RB) means more/less passing/rushing yards
# I know this doesn't take in to account overall schemes of the teams, conference, overall strength of schedule, I am just curious if size matters... or not.
